## Goal
- To build a classifier model that predicts crop disease on images of cassava plants from Uganda and customize model behavior during training using callbacks.

### Objectives
- Read in data with multiple classes.
- Transform data and prepare it for training.
- Use transfer learning to train a classifier model on cassava images.
- Improve training by implementing various callbacks.
- Prepare a submission for our competition by reformatting network predictions on the test set.

### New Terms:
- Callbacks
- Learning Rate Scheduling
- Checkpointing
- Early Stopping
